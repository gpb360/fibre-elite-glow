I understand you need a placeholder for the fruit-veg-bottle.jpg file. Since this is a binary image file, I can't generate the actual JPG content in my response. 

The image you shared in our conversation (showing a glass bottle filled with various fruits and vegetables) should be saved to this path:
`public/images/fruit-veg-bottle.jpg`

This image will serve as the background for the Hero section with reduced opacity (20%) to create that high-end feel we discussed. The Hero component has already been updated to reference this image path.

Based on the PowerShell command we tried earlier, it appears the image may have been successfully copied from your Downloads folder to the correct location. If not, you'll need to manually save the image to that path.
