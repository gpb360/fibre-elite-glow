  - heading "What is Premium Apple Fiber?" [level=2]
  - paragraph: A balanced source of both soluble and insoluble fiber derived from carefully selected apples.
  - paragraph: Premium Apple Fiber is derived from the pulp and peel of specially selected apples, providing a perfect balance of both soluble and insoluble fiber. This natural fiber source is carefully processed to preserve its nutritional integrity and functional benefits while removing excess sugars and moisture.
  - paragraph: What makes apple fiber unique is its balanced composition of approximately 2-3% total fiber, with an optimal ratio of soluble to insoluble fiber. The primary soluble fiber in apples is pectin, a gel-forming compound with remarkable health benefits, particularly for cholesterol management and digestive health.
  - paragraph: Our premium apple fiber undergoes a specialized low-temperature drying process that preserves the functional properties of both fiber types. This gentle processing ensures that the pectin remains intact and effective, while the insoluble fiber maintains its structure for optimal digestive benefits.

  - heading "The Dual-Fiber Advantage" [level=2]
  - paragraph: Understanding the complementary benefits of soluble and insoluble fiber in apples
  - img
  - heading "Soluble Fiber (Pectin)" [level=3]
  - paragraph: Dissolves in water to form a gel-like substance that slows digestion, binds to cholesterol, and helps regulate blood sugar levels. Apple pectin is particularly effective at forming a viscous gel that traps cholesterol and bile acids, facilitating their removal from the body.
  - img
  - heading "Insoluble Fiber (Cellulose)" [level=3]
  - paragraph: Doesn't dissolve in water but adds bulk to stool and helps food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestines. This type of fiber is essential for preventing constipation and maintaining regular bowel movements, supporting overall digestive health.
  - heading "Synergistic Effects" [level=3]
  - paragraph: "The combination of both fiber types in apple fiber creates a synergistic effect that provides more comprehensive health benefits than either type alone. This balanced approach supports:"

  - heading "Supports Cholesterol Management" [level=3]
  - paragraph: Soluble fiber, particularly pectin, binds to cholesterol in the digestive tract, helping to reduce its absorption and maintain healthy cholesterol levels.
  - img
  - heading "Balances Blood Sugar" [level=3]
  - paragraph: By slowing the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, apple fiber helps prevent rapid spikes in blood glucose levels after meals.
  - img
  - heading "Promotes Satiety" [level=3]
  - paragraph: The fiber in apples creates a feeling of fullness, which can help with appetite control and support healthy weight management goals.

  - heading "How Apple Fiber Works" [level=2]
  - paragraph: The science behind this gentle yet powerful digestive and heart health supporter
  - img
  - heading "Cholesterol Binding" [level=4]
  - paragraph: The pectin in apple fiber forms a gel-like substance in the digestive tract that binds to cholesterol and bile acids (which are made from cholesterol). This prevents their reabsorption and facilitates their elimination from the body, helping to lower blood cholesterol levels.
  - img
  - heading "Stool Bulking" [level=4]
  - paragraph: The insoluble fiber in apples adds bulk to stool and absorbs water, making waste softer and easier to pass. This helps prevent constipation and supports regular, comfortable bowel movements without causing dependency or irritation.
  - img
  - heading "Prebiotic Activity" [level=4]
  - paragraph: Apple fiber serves as food for beneficial gut bacteria, promoting their growth and activity. As these bacteria ferment the fiber, they produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which nourish colon cells and support gut health.
  - img
  - heading "Blood Sugar Regulation" [level=4]
  - paragraph: The soluble fiber in apples slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream by forming a barrier between carbohydrates and digestive enzymes. This helps prevent rapid spikes in blood glucose levels after meals, supporting stable energy and metabolic health.
  - img
  - heading "Satiety Signaling" [level=4]
  - paragraph: Apple fiber absorbs water and expands in the stomach, creating a feeling of fullness that helps regulate appetite and support healthy weight management. This effect is enhanced by the slower digestion and absorption of nutrients that fiber promotes.
