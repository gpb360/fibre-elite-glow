# React Hydration Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration errors due to browser extensions modifying the DOM before React hydration. Specifically, the `data-atm-ext-installed="1.29.10"` attribute was being added to the body element, causing a mismatch between server-rendered HTML and client-side expectations.

## Root Cause
- Browser extensions inject attributes/elements into the DOM after server rendering but before React hydration
- The `className={inter.className}` on the `<body>` element was causing hydration mismatches
- Server renders clean HTML, but client sees modified DOM with extension attributes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to body element
```tsx
<body suppressHydrationWarning>
```

### 2. Created ClientBodyWrapper Component
- Handles font class application after hydration
- Prevents server/client mismatch during initial render
- Uses the same pattern as the existing Sonner component

### 3. Updated Layout Structure
- Moved font class application to client-side only
- Maintains styling while preventing hydration errors
- Preserves all existing functionality

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates hydration errors caused by browser extensions
- ✅ Maintains Inter font styling
- ✅ No impact on performance or user experience
- ✅ Follows React best practices for SSR/hydration
- ✅ Robust against future browser extension interference

## Files Modified
- `app/layout.tsx` - Updated to use ClientBodyWrapper
- `app/components/ClientBodyWrapper.tsx` - New component for handling font classes

## Testing
- Application starts successfully without hydration warnings
- Font styling is preserved
- Compatible with browser extensions that modify DOM
