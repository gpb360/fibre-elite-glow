# Stripe Email Receipt Configuration Fix

## Issue Identified
Customers were not receiving confirmation emails after checkout because:
1. The checkout session was not configured to send email receipts
2. The `receipt_email` parameter was missing from the payment intent

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Checkout Session Configuration
Added `payment_intent_data` with `receipt_email` to the checkout session creation:

```typescript
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
  line_items: lineItems,
  mode: STRIPE_CONFIG.mode,
  success_url: `${baseUrl}/checkout/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
  cancel_url: `${baseUrl}/cart`,
  customer_email: body.customerInfo.email,
  metadata,
  // Enable automatic email receipts
  payment_intent_data: {
    receipt_email: body.customerInfo.email,
  },
});
```

### 2. Verify Stripe Dashboard Settings

To ensure email receipts are working, check these settings in your Stripe Dashboard:

#### A. Customer Email Settings
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Settings > Customer emails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)
2. Under "Email customers about", ensure **"Successful payments"** is enabled
3. This setting controls automatic receipt emails for all payments

#### B. Branding Settings (Optional)
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Settings > Branding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding)
2. Add your logo and customize colors for professional-looking receipts
3. Set your business name and contact information

#### C. Public Details Settings (Optional)
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Settings > Public details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)
2. Add your business address, phone number, and website
3. This information appears on receipts

## How Email Receipts Work

### Automatic Receipt Flow
1. Customer completes checkout
2. Stripe processes the payment
3. Stripe automatically sends email receipt to `receipt_email` address
4. Receipt includes:
   - Payment confirmation
   - Order details
   - Receipt number
   - Business information (from branding settings)

### Receipt Content
- **Subject**: "Receipt from [Your Business Name]"
- **Content**: 
  - Payment amount and currency
  - Items purchased
  - Payment method (last 4 digits of card)
  - Receipt number for reference
  - Business contact information

## Testing Email Receipts

### 1. Test Mode
- Use test card numbers (e.g., `4242424242424242`)
- Email receipts are sent in test mode
- Check spam/junk folders if not received

### 2. Live Mode
- Use real payment methods
- Receipts are sent to actual customer emails
- Monitor for delivery issues

## Troubleshooting

### If Receipts Still Not Sent

1. **Check Stripe Dashboard Settings**:
   - Verify "Successful payments" is enabled in Customer emails
   - Check if email domain is verified (if using custom domain)

2. **Check Email Address**:
   - Ensure customer email is valid
   - Check for typos in email collection

3. **Check Spam Filters**:
   - Receipts might be filtered as spam
   - Add Stripe's email domain to whitelist

4. **Verify Payment Success**:
   - Only successful payments trigger receipts
   - Failed or pending payments don't send receipts

### Common Issues

1. **Email Not Received**:
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify email address is correct
   - Ensure Stripe settings are enabled

2. **Receipt Missing Information**:
   - Update branding settings in Dashboard
   - Add business details in public settings

3. **Wrong Email Address**:
   - Verify customer email collection in checkout form
   - Check API payload includes correct email

## Verification Steps

After implementing the fix:

1. **Test a Checkout**:
   - Complete a test purchase
   - Check email within 5-10 minutes
   - Verify receipt contains correct information

2. **Check Payment Intent**:
   - In Stripe Dashboard, view the payment
   - Confirm `receipt_email` field is populated
   - Check payment status is "succeeded"

3. **Monitor Email Logs**:
   - Stripe Dashboard shows email delivery status
   - Check for any delivery failures

## Expected Result

After this fix:
- ✅ Customers receive email receipts automatically
- ✅ Receipts include order details and business information
- ✅ Works for both test and live payments
- ✅ Integrates with existing checkout flow

The email receipt will be sent from Stripe's email system and include all the necessary payment confirmation details for your customers.
