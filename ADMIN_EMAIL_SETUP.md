Your code is ready! Deploy to Netlify:

git pull origin main  # Pull the latest changes
# Your Netlify deployment will automatically trigger
```

### 2. ⚙️ Configure Stripe Webhook
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. **Endpoint URL**: `https://lebve.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
4. **Events to send**:
   - ✅ `checkout.session.completed` (for successful orders)
   - ✅ `payment_intent.payment_failed` (for failed payments)
5. Click "Add endpoint"
6. **Copy the webhook signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

### 3. 🔧 Add Environment Variables in Netlify
Go to your Netlify site dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables:

**Required Variables:**
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...         # Your Stripe secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...       # From step 2 above
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@lbve.ca            # Where to send notifications
EMAIL_PROVIDER=console                # Start with console for testing
```

**Optional Variables (for production):**
```
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@lbve.ca
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@lbve.ca
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-custom-admin-password
```

### 4. 🧪 Test the System

#### Phase 1: Console Testing (Recommended First)
1. **Make a test purchase** on your website
2. **Check Netlify Function logs**:
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard → Functions → stripe-webhook → View logs
   - Look for email output that looks like:
   ```
   === EMAIL NOTIFICATION ===
   To: admin@lbve.ca
   Subject: 🛒 New Order: cs_123456 - $79.99
   HTML Content: [Beautiful HTML email with all order details]
   ========================
   ```

#### Phase 2: Real Email Sending (After testing)
Set up SendGrid for production:
1. Sign up for [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) (free tier available)
2. Create an API key
3. Update environment variables:
   ```
   EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_api_key_here
   ```
