# Webhook Flow Diagnosis - October 20, 2025

## 🔍 Current Status Check

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Webhook Endpoint**: `/api/webhooks/stripe` is ACTIVE and responding
2. **Environment Variables**: All properly configured
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: ✅ Available
   - `RESEND_API_KEY`: ✅ Available
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: ✅ Available
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL`: admin@lbve.ca ✅ Available

3. **Webhook Validation**: ✅ Properly rejecting invalid signatures
4. **Development Server**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:3010

### 🚨 Potential Issues Identified

#### Issue 1: Stripe Dashboard Webhook Configuration
- **Expected URL**: `https://lbve.venomapdevelopment.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
- **Current Status**: Need to verify in Stripe Dashboard
- **Common Problem**: Wrong URL in Stripe webhook settings

#### Issue 2: Test Mode vs Live Mode
- **Current Keys**: TEST keys (sk_test_*)
- **Webhook Secret**: Test webhook secret (whsec_400f9b31...)
- **Issue**: Webhooks configured for LIVE mode won't trigger with TEST payments

#### Issue 3: Webhook Event Types
- **Expected Events**: `checkout.session.completed`
- **Need to verify**: All required events are selected in Stripe webhook configuration

## 🔧 Immediate Action Items

### 1. Check Stripe Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Find your webhook configuration
3. Verify the endpoint URL is: `https://lbve.venomapdevelopment.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Ensure these events are selected:
   - ✅ checkout.session.completed
   - ✅ payment_intent.succeeded (optional but recommended)

### 2. Test with Stripe CLI (Working)
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3010/api/webhooks/stripe
```
Then trigger a test payment to verify the flow works.

### 3. Check Development Mode Handling
The webhook handler has development mode bypass logic:
- In `NODE_ENV=development`, some validations are relaxed
- Ensure this is working as expected

## 📊 Expected Flow When Working

1. **Customer completes Stripe checkout**
2. **Stripe sends webhook** → `https://lbve.venomapdevelopment.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. **Webhook processes event** → Creates order in Supabase
4. **Email service triggers** → Sends confirmation to customer
5. **Admin notification** → Sends email to admin@lbve.ca

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test Webhook Directly:
```bash
# Use the webhook-test endpoint
curl http://localhost:3010/api/webhook-test
```

### Test Complete Flow:
1. Add items to cart
2. Complete checkout in test mode
3. Check for emails:
   - Customer: Should receive order confirmation
   - Admin: Should receive new order notification

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Verify Stripe webhook configuration** in dashboard
2. **Test with Stripe CLI** to simulate events
3. **Check email delivery** by monitoring Resend dashboard
4. **Monitor Supabase orders table** for new records
