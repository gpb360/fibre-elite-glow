## 🎓 TanStack Query v5 Best Practices Applied

Based on official documentation from TanStack Query v5.84.1:

### ✅ Correct Next.js App Router Setup
- **'use client' directive** on providers
- **Stable QueryClient instance** using useState
- **Proper provider hierarchy** in component tree

### ✅ Modern Query Syntax
- **Object-based configuration** (not legacy tuple syntax)
- **Array query keys** for cache management
- **Async query functions** with proper error handling

### ✅ Type Safety
- **TypeScript interfaces** for data types
- **Generic type parameters** for useQuery
- **Proper return type inference**

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`scripts/verify-react-query.js`** - Comprehensive verification script
2. **`src/hooks/__tests__/usePackages.test.tsx`** - Unit tests for usePackages hook
3. **`docs/TANSTACK_QUERY_FIX.md`** - Detailed resolution documentation
4. **`TANSTACK_QUERY_RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

### Modified Files
- None (no code changes required - issue was missing dependencies)

### Verified Existing Files
- ✅ `package.json` - Correct dependency listed
- ✅ `app/providers.tsx` - Proper QueryClientProvider setup
- ✅ `src/hooks/usePackages.ts` - Valid useQuery implementation

## 🚀 How to Use

### Run Verification Anytime
```bash
node scripts/verify-react-query.js
```

### Run Tests
```bash

npm test src/hooks/__tests__/usePackages.test.tsx
```

### Development Server
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash

## ⚠️ Known Separate Issue

The build process shows an environment variable error:
```
Error: ❌ Stripe secret key not found
```

**This is NOT related to @tanstack/react-query.** The React Query module resolution is working perfectly.

**To resolve the environment issue:**
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Stripe and Supabase credentials
3. See `docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` for details
